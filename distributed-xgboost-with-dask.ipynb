    "# Distributed XGBoost with Dask on CML\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll demonstrate a simple application for detecting credit card fraud by training a distributed XGBoost model using Dask, a library for scaling and parallelizing Python applications. [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) allows easy management of distributed workers and excels at handling large distributed data science workflows. The [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package now includes [Dask integration](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dask.html) through two APIs: a functional interface (that we'll demonstrate here) and one that is modeled after Scikit-Learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed computing\n",
    "It's important to understand what we mean by \"distributed\" computing, since there are several paradigms for scaling machine learning workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory-constrained.**\n",
    "In this scenario the data is larger than can comfortably fit into memory and must instead be distributed across the nodes of your cluster. This necessitates distributing your ML model across those same nodes, a feature of ensemble models like XGBoost. This is the type of distributed computing we demonstrate in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Compute-constrained.** \n",
    "In this scenario, the data fits in memory but the model size or training complexity is such that execution would simply take too long to complete in a reasonable time. This can happen, for example, when tuning a large model's hyperparameters or when performing cross validation. One way to handle this is to parallelize the computation, e.g., use each node in the cluster to train a separate set of hyperparameters for a given model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We do *not* perform this kind of distributed computing because, in our scenario, all the nodes in the cluster are already being used to handle the distributed data load! Instead, we perforrm hyperparameter tuning _sequentially_. We demonstrate how we roll our own quick and dirty hyperparameter tuning loop to handle this. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the dataset\n",
    "We'll work with a sample of the [credit card fraud dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) curated by the machine learning group at Université Libre de Bruxelles. (You can obtain the full dataset by creating a Kaggle account and downloading from the link above.) The same group have a [handbook](https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/fraud-detection-handbook/Foreword.html) detailing the application of machine learning for fraud detection, which provides considerably more depth than we do here. Creating a realistic fraud detection system is far too mighty a task for a single humble notebook, and so the dataset here serves only as an example for the purpose of demonstrating the technologies. Namely: scaling the training of XGBoost on a Dask cluster on CML. Throughout the process we'll also demonstrate how to use other supporting Dask libraries for a nearly end-to-end scaled ML workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In addition to demonstrating Dask + XGBoost, this notebook also highlights a typical data science workflow. For that, we perform the following: \n",
    "* We first [load, explore, and visualize](#load_data) the credit card fraud dataset\n",
    "* Next, we establish [baseline classifiers](#baselines) as a gut check, and to serve as a point of comparison for more complex models\n",
    "* We spin up a Dask Cluster train a [distributed XGBoost](#distributed_xgboost) classifier\n",
    "* We perform [tuning](#hp_tuning) of the XGBoost hyperparamters\n",
    "* Finally, we compare our best XGBoost model to our baselines and [validate](#validation) on a hold-out set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code examples in this notebook are drawn in part from the [documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/dask.html) and [this blog post](https://medium.com/rapids-ai/a-new-official-dask-api-for-xgboost-e8b10f3d1eb7) published by RAPIDS AI, both excellent sources for further details.

    "It looks like there's some reasonable separation between fraudulent and non-fradulent transactions via some of the PCA feature distributions. This signals that there's a good chance we can learn to discriminate fraudulent transactions on the basis of these features. (Even those distributions that overlap extremely well may be useful in combination with other features). Keep in mind that that downsampling non-fraudulent transactions so severely introduces a lot of statistical noise - run the sampling repeatedly to draw new samples.\n",

    "What does this number mean? Let's recall how sklearn constructs a [PR curve](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve.html). The first precision and recall values of the PR curve are precision=class balance and recall=1.0 which corresponds to a classifier that always predicts the \"positive class\" (fraud, in this case). Because we have such an imbalanced dataset, this point is essentially [0.0017, 1.].  Since our dummy classifier only predicts the **majority class** (_not_ fraud), there are no thresholds over which to build the PR curve, and so, by default, the last precision and recall values in the curve are 1. and 0. This results in a line from essentially [0, 1] to [1, 0], which yields an aucpr of approximately 0.5. This is the lowest aucpr we could possibly get for this problem so we should certainly be able to improve it! \n",

    "#### Determine a threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The aucpr metric is good for identifying the best overall model during the model development process. However, the goal of our analysis is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent, and for that we need to determine a threshold to apply to the XGBoost predictions. The PR curve above shows us what different thresholds will yield us and it is up to the business use case whether to optimize for better precision or better recall. This determination will have several considerations, including how costly it is for our model to make a mistake. For example, falsely identifying something as fraud when it is *not* might merely be an inconvenience to our customers, while failing to report true fraud would result in real monetary loss and very angry customers. \n",
